# ClimateCool
Automating Cooling Load Calculations with MATLAB App based on ASHRAE Standards
***
## General Info
ClimateCool is a MATLABÂ® Application based on ASHRAE Standards which can automate cooling load calculation procedure. It takeses all building parameters like material, dimensions, direction and occupancy including electric appliances as input and based on data, calculates cooling load for that building utilizing CLTD method. 
## Source File
ClimateCoolSource.zip is source file including editable code, GUI and source pictures. It can be used to improve capabilities of application.
***
## Installation
### Supported platform 
Windows 64 bit x86.
***
### Setup instructions
To install ClimateCool Application download ClimateCoolInstaller and then run it on your PC it will ask permission to download MATLAB Runtime Installer and following instruction it will be installed and you can create desktop shortcut as well.

## Getting started
To run the analysis, open ClimateCool Application using desktop shortcut. Input all required parameters of building like thermal resistivity of material used, dimensions and directions including people and electric appliances. Click load button of each section to load that section for input. Then click on solve button to get cooling load in different units like kW, ToR (ton of referigeration) and Btu/hr.
